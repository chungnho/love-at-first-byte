## Ingredients

2 cups self-raising flour  
1 teaspoon ground mixed spice  
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg  
1/2 teaspoon ginger  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract  
1 cup light brown sugar  
3 cups grated carrot   
1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans   
1/3 cup dessicated coconut (optional)  
3/4 cup vegetable oil  
3 eggs, lightly beaten  

### Frosting  

1/2 cup of unsalted butter  
1/2 cup of cream cheese frosting  
1 cup powdered sugar  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1/2 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans  
1 orange  

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line the bottom of your pan with parchment paper (for ideally 2 small cake pans).
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, mixed spice and salt until well combined.
3. In a separate large mixing bowl, whisk together the vegetable oil, eggs, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract until fully combined. 
4. Add the grated carrots, dessicated coconut and pecans or walnuts into the wet ingredients and mix until well combined.
5. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix with a rubber spatula until just combined, making sure not to over mix the batter.
6. Pour the cake batter evenly between both prepared cake pans. 
7. Bake at 350°F for 30-35 minutes or until the tops of the cakes are set and a toothpick inserted into the center of each one comes out clean. 
8. Remove from the oven, transfer to a wire rack, and allow to cool in the pans for about 20 to 25 minutes. 
9. Once the cakes have cooled, remove from the pans and return the cakes to the wire rack to finish cooling.

### Frosting

1. Zest the orange skin and set aside.
2. Cut open the orange and hand squeeze it for some orange juice.
3. In a large mixing bowl using a hand-held mixer, combine the cream cheese and roughly 2 tabelspoons of the orange juice.
4. Beat the mixture until smooth. 
5. Add the butter and mix for about 30 seconds to 1 minute until well combined and smooth. 
6. Add in the powdered sugar and vanilla extract and continue mixing until fully combined.
7. Spread the frosting on top of the cake once the cake has cooled.
8. Decorate with some pecans and orange zest on top.

### Notes
* For a fluffier cake, sift the flour before adding in the rest of the dry ingredients.
