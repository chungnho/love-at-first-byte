# Ube Maracrons

## Ingredients

### Shells

- 3 Eegg whites (aged)
- 50 g Fine white sugar
- Pinch of Salt
- 1/4 tsp Cream of tartar
- 200 g Icing sugar
- 120 g Almond flour
- 3/4 tsp Ube flavouring

### Filling

- 60 g Salted butter (softened)
- 50 g Icing sugar
- 3 tbsp Ube Halaya
- A few drops of Ube flavouring

## Instructions

### Age egg whites

1. Separate egg whites into a clean bowl
2. Place plastic wrap over bowl and poke some large holes in the top
3. Keep in the fridge for at least 24h (up to 4 days)

### Shells

1. Allow egg whites to come to room temperature
2. Beat egg whites until foamy
3. Add salt, cream of tartar and white sugar; beat until stiff peaks (8-10min)
4. Add ube flavouring
5. Sift almond flour and icing sugar twice
6. Fold the sifted dry mixture into meringue mixture. 65-75 good strokes - do not overmix!
7. Preheat the oven to 150C (300F) fan forced - recommend using oven thermometer for accuracy
8. Transfer mixture into piping bag
9. Pipe into 1 inch disks on baking paper - do not overcrowd as they will spread
10. Tap the pan hard a few times to release any air bubbles - avoids cracks on the top
11. Rest for ~30min (up to 60min) until they are tacky to the touch (but no longer sticky) - this is to dry them out to avoid spread during baking so they rise and develop feet
12. Bake for 20min - do not underbake! They should lift off the baking paper easily
13. Transfer baked shells onto cooling rack and rest until completely cooled

### Buttercream filling

1. Beat softened butter
2. Add icing sugar and beat until combined
3. Add ube halaya and ube flavouring and combine well
4. Transfer buttercream to piping bag

### Assembly

1. Once shells are completely cooled, pair them together
2. Pipe buttercream onto one shell and pressing other shell to create sandwich
3. Serve fresh

## Notes

- Found baking paper much better than silicon mat - shells stuck to silicon mats while coming off baking paper very easily
