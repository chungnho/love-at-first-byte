# Mussels in White Wine

## Ingredients

2 cups white wine  
1 tablespoon butter  
1 teaspoon oregano  
1 teaspoon chopped (fresh) parsley  
4 cloves garlic  
2 pounds mussels  
pinch of salt  
pinch of white pepper  

## Instructions

1. Soak mussels in water for at least 5 minutes.
2. On low heat, melt the butter in a pot.
3. Add the garlic and simmer until it is aromatically infused with the butter.
4. Add the white wine, salt, white pepper and oregano to the pot and turn up the heat.
5. Once at boiling temperature, drain the mussels and add to pot.
6. Cover the pot with a lid.
7. Stir the mussels in the pot every minute.
8. Check around the 5-7 minute mark and remove pot from heat once mussels open up. 
9. Serve and sprinkle parsley on top.

### Notes
* Do NOT overcook the mussels, it should be removed from heat as soon as they open up.
* Do NOT use a sweet white wine or a sparkling wine; Chardonnay is a dry white wine and is best for this recipe.
* Do serve yourself a glass of white wine whilst cooking.
