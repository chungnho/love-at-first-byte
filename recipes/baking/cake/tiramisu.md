### Soak sponge in coffee mixture

5. Set in fridge for a few hours

### Serve

## Notes

- Gelatine doesn’t dissolve in cold water. It forms lumps if stirred directly into hot water. The best way is to stir gelatine into the required amount of cold water in a mug, then place the mug in a pan of hot water. Stir until you get a clear mixture.
- Marscapone does not like sudden temperature changes, ensure that it is at room temperature before using
- If the marscapone forms lumps, stir over a hot water bath until it smoothens
- Marscapone is sweeter than cream cheese, can reduce the sugar in the filling if desired
- Ladyfingers can be used instead of baking the sponges
