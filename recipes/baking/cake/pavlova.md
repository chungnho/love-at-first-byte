## Reference

## Notes

- Easiest to bake the base the evening before and let it cool overnight - the slower it cools the less likely it will collapse/sink
- The vinegar and cornflour (and salt) help to give it a bit more structure so that it doesn't collapse as much.
- The meringue may (still) collapse a little, that's fine just cover it up with cream
- Try not to overbake, the centre should be set like a marshmallow consistency but the exterior and crunchy shell
- Only full fat cream will whip up, do not try to use light cream
- Cream whips up much easier when it is cold (can chill the mixing bowl it is whipped in as well)
- Monitor your cream closely as you whip it, it can very quickly go from not-ready to over-whipped (like whipped butter)
