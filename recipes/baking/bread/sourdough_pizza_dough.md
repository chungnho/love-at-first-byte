# Sourdough Pizza Dough

Makes 2 290g dough balls

## Ingredients

- 320 g All purpose flour
- 215 g Water (67%)
- 6 g Salt (2%)
- 48 g Starter (15%)

## Instructions

1. Mix - should develop a bit of strength and produce a shaggy mass
   1. Combine 165g Water (50g less than the full amount) with the starter in a mixing bowl
   2. Mix in flour and salt (so it's a little bit combined)
   3. Use the dough hook on the mixer (at speed 2 for a KitchenAid) for a few minutes until it becomes 1 mass
   4. Add remaining 50g of water gradually
2. Bulk fermentation - 2.5h:
   1. Perform 3-4 sets of stretch and fold every 30min
   2. Skip last set if quite stiff after the 3rd (but rest for the remainder 2.5h)
   3. Dump dough on bench and shape into a tight boule
   4. Transfer boule to oiled bowl, wrap with plastic wrap and place in fridge overnight
3. Divide and ball:
   1. Dump dought onto unfloured bench and divide into 2 balls
   2. Shape into 2 tight balls with as little flour as possible. Ensure it is fully sealed on the bottom
   3. Transfered to lightly oiled baking tray for proofing
4. Proofing - they should flatten out from the tight balls
   1. Cover with plastic wrap and proof for 6h at room temperature
