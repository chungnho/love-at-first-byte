# Pork and Fennel Sausage Rolls

## Ingredients

### Filling

- 1/2 tbsp Olive oil
- 2 cloves Garlic (minced)
- 1 Brown onion (small, finely chopped)
- 1 Celery stalk (finely chopped)
- 150 g (5 oz) Bacon (streaky) (finely minced)
- 2 tsp Fennel seeds (toasted)
- 500 g (1 lb) Pork mince
- 3/4 cup / 40g Panko breadcrumbs
- 1 Egg
- 1/2 tsp Salt
- Black pepper

### Rest of Dish

- 2-2.5 sheets of puff pastry (cut into half)
- 1 Egg (optional - can use water)

## Instructions

### Prep

1. Heat oil in a non stick fry pan over medium high heat
2. Saut√© garlic, onion & celery for 2 minutes, then add bacon
3. Cook for a further 2 minutes (don't make bacon golden); then transfer to bowl and allow to cool for 10 minutes
4. Add remaining Filling ingredients into the bowl and mix well
5. Lay out a rectangle of pastry, long edge closest to you. Brush egg (or water) along one long edge
6. Get 1/5 (or 1/4 if only using 2 sheets of pastry) of the filling and shape into a long log shape down the middle of the pastry. Ensure the meat is tight and compact, without gaps
7. Roll up, sealing on the edge with egg wash on it.
8. Refrigerate/freeze for 1 hour before cutting
9. Freeze for future baking or proceed to baking

### Bake

1. Preheat oven to 180C (350F)
2. Brush with egg (optional) and place on baking tray lined with baking paper (or spreayed with oil)
3. Bake for 30 - 35 minutes in total, swapping tray shelves at 20 minutes, or until the pastry is deep golden brown. (Note: The filling will still look pink because of the bacon, but it's easy to tell from texture that it's cooked)
4. Cool slightly on trays. Serve hot or warm
