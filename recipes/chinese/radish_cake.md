# Radish Cake

## Ingredients

### Main

- ~1.2 kg Chinese radish after cleaned and peeled (~1.3-1.4kg)
- 300 g Rice flour
- 1/2 tbsp Salt
- 1/8 tsp White pepper
- 1/2 tbsp Sugar
- 2 tsp Chicken bouillon powder

### Filling

- ~2 Chinese sausage (steamed)
- ~5 Dried shiitake mushrooms (soaked)
- ~10 Dried shrimp (soaked)
- 2 dried scallops (optional)

### Garnish

- 2 stalks Spring onion (finely chopped)
- Sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Prep the filling
   1. Dice the chinese sausage, shiitake mushrooms and dried shrimp
   2. Stir fry chinese sausage, shiitake mushrooms and dried shrimp in a wok with a small amount of oil; then set aside
   3. Steam dried scallops in a small amount of water for 30 min
   4. Reserve scallop water; shred scallop and set aside
2. Wash and peel chinese radish; then weigh
3. Adjust rice flour according to the radish weight (~1/4 of the radish weight - round down)
4. Grate radish (a variation of some more roughly chopped/grated radish adds texture)
5. Cook radish with sugar and chicken bouillon powder in pan until soft (~15min)
6. Drain radish juice from pan and let cool (keep radish warm)
7. Combine rice flour with salt and white pepper
8. Add cooled radish juice (and reserved scallop water) to flour mixture to form a paste (add additional water as needed)
9. Stir the flour paste into the warm/hot radish
10. Add the filling and combine well
11. Transfer into a greased pan
12. Steam for 1-1.5h (skewer should come out clean)
13. Add chopped spring onions in the last 2min of steaming
14. Garnish with sesame seeds
15. Cover and cool on the bench for a few hours before transferring to fridge to cool completely
16. Slice and pan fry to serve

## Notes

- Picking a radish is not an exact science - try to pick a hefty one for a juicier radish. If you can see a cross-section avoid any that have white opaque dots (those are stringy fibres)
- Getting the flour paste to the right consistency is important - do not making it too runny otherwise it won't set correctly, but if it's too thick the texture will also be a bit stiff
  - Approximately 1:1 flour to liquid
- Do not be tempted to add too much filling
