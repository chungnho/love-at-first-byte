2. Vegetables
   1. Fry diced shiitake mushrooms on medium - medium-high heat
   2. Add seasoning
      1. 1/4 tsp Light soy sauce
      2. 1 tsp Sugar
      3. 1/2 tbsp Shaoxing wine
3. Meat

   2. Add diced dried shrimp
   3. Add seasoning
      1. 1/2 tsp Sugar
      2. 1/2 tbsp Shaoxing wine
4. Rice

      - NB:
        - If the rice is sticking to the wok too much, add oil
        - If the rice is softening too slowly, skip the 30s frying (just uncover, add more water, and re-cover)
        - If the rice is softening too fast, don't cover
   5. Add the last bit of water without covering and mix well
      - Check the texture of the rice - should be just past al-dente
   6. Toss in the meat and vegetables, and add seasoning (adjust seasoning as needed)
   7. In the last 30-60s, toss in spring onions and egg
5. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve
